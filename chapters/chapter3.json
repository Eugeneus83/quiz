According to one current industry estimate, 200 million bottles of bubble liquid are sold annually. Tim Kehoe, a toy inventor from St. Paul, Minnesota, dreamed of taking the classic, transparent bubble one step further. He devoted eleven years of his life to creating colored bubbles – bubbles of a single vibrant hue, be it green, blue, or pink.</p><p>  The realization of Kehoe's dream proved to be no simple undertaking. In the process, he stained his car, several bathtubs, and a few dozen children. He ruined kitchen countertops and corporate conference tables, and caused a chemical fire or two. Eventually, he succeeded in making colored bubbles with a dye that could be washed off skin and clothing, but market research showed that the product was still not ready. Even temporary stains horrified parents. Unfortunately for Kehoe, in the history of organic chemistry no one had ever created a water-soluble dye that faded spontaneously. </p><p>   Kehoe called in Dr. Ram Sabnis, one of a handful of experts on dye chemistry in the world. Sabnis, who eventually solved the problem, says the project was the most difficult he had ever worked on. \"Nobody has made this chemistry before. We have synthesized a whole new class of dyes.\" Zubbles, the product of Sabnis and Kehoe's collaboration, appeared on the market in 2009 – to the delight of bubble lovers big and small. </add-space-line></add-space-line>"],"answers":null,"highlights":null,"base_word":"","img_path":null,"audio_path":null},"domain_code":null,"shuffleable":0,"classname":"BulkItem","super_item_id":null,"params":null,"super_item_name":null},{"id":20867,"name":"308214-2-2","item_version":2,"element_type_old":"","category":null,"item_key_old":null,"inst_unit_id":null,"is_complex_item":false,"is_cat_item":false,"language_id":2,"button_text":null,"instruction_text":null,"super_item_index":1,"display_type":0,"created_at":"2023-12-12T13:12:49.000Z","updated_at":"2023-12-17T11:27:30.000Z","details":{"textList":["An appropriate title for this text would be -"],"answers":[{"index":"1","order":1,"text":" The Hazards of Inventing Toys"},{"index":"2","order":2,"text":" Zubbles: A Classic Toy Reinvented"},{"index":"3","order":3,"text":" How Kehoe and Sabnis Revolutionized the Toy Market"},{"index":"4","order":4,"text":" Spontaneous Fading: Water-Soluble Dyes"}],"highlights":null,"base_word":"","img_path":null,"audio_path":null},"domain_code":null,"shuffleable":0,"classname":"ReadingComprehensionItem","super_item_id":20866,"params":null,"super_item_name":"30349-2-2-P"},{"id":20868,"name":"308209-2-2","item_version":2,"element_type_old":"","category":null,"item_key_old":null,"inst_unit_id":null,"is_complex_item":false,"is_cat_item":false,"language_id":2,"button_text":null,"instruction_text":null,"super_item_index":2,"display_type":0,"created_at":"2023-12-12T13:12:49.000Z","updated_at":"2023-12-17T11:27:30.000Z","details":{"textList":["The main purpose of the first paragraph is to -
